## Getting Started

To get started with Media Sorter, you need to download the latest release. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/ismailuysall/Media-Sorter/releases) section to download the script. After downloading, follow the steps below to set it up.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ismailuysall/Media-Sorter.git
   cd Media-Sorter
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Use pip to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/ismailuysall/Media-Sorter/releases) section to download the latest version of the script.

## Usage

Once you have set up the Media Sorter, you can run it using the command line. Here's how:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script.
3. Run the script with the following command:
   ```bash
   python media_sorter.py <source_directory> <destination_directory>
   ```

Replace `<source_directory>` with the path to the folder containing your media files, and `<destination_directory>` with the path where you want to save the organized files.

### Example

```bash
python media_sorter.py /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```

## How It Works

Media Sorter uses EXIF data embedded in your media files to determine the date they were taken. It then creates a folder structure based on the year, month, and day. This structure makes it easy to find and view your photos and videos.

### Steps Involved

1. **File Scanning**: The script scans the source directory for all media files.
2. **EXIF Data Extraction**: It extracts the EXIF metadata to get the creation date of each file.
3. **Folder Creation**: Based on the extracted dates, the script creates a corresponding folder structure in the destination directory.
4. **File Moving**: Finally, it moves the files into their respective folders.
